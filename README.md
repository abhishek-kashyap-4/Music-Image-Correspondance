# Music-Image-Correspondance
This codes satisfies your curiosity of wondering how audio files look like and how images sound like. 
The code manipulates the data of the files to convert one format to another. 
The results give some interesting results.


A wav file with multiple channels converted to rgb:
![Wav file to rgbimage](/Image/output/RGB/OneWav.png =250x250)

Gray:
![Wav file to Gray](/Image/output/Gray/OneWav.png |width=100)


What appears chaotic has a lot of order just from a different perspective.
